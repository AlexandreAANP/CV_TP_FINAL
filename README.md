# VisualDesktop

**VisualDesktop** is a Python-based project that uses OpenCV and MediaPipe to create a futuristic desktop experience.

It allows users to control applications by interacting with icons on the screen using hand gestures detected by the camera. By tracking finger positions, users can perform various actions without needing a physical mouse or keyboard.
